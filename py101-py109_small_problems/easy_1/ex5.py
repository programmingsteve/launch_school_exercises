# Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount
# and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip, then print both the tip and
# the total amount of the bill. You can ignore input validation and assume that
# the user will enter valid numbers.

bill = float(input('What is the bill? '))
tip_percentage = float(input('What is the tip percentage? '))

tip = bill * (tip_percentage / 100)
total = bill + tip

print(f'The tip is ${tip:.2f}.')
print(f'The total is ${total:.2f}.')
